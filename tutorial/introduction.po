"In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the "
"presence or absence of prompts (:term:`>>>` and :term:`...`): to repeat the "
"example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; "
"lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note "
"that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must "
"type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on ``>>>`` in "
"the upper-right corner of an example box.  If you hide the prompts and "
"output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input lines "
"into your interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive "
"prompt, include comments.  Comments in Python start with the hash character, "
"``#``, and extend to the end of the physical line.  A comment may appear at "
"the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string "
"literal.  A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. "
"Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they "
"may be omitted when typing in examples."

msgid "Using Python as a Calculator"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's try some simple Python commands.  Start the interpreter and wait for "
"the primary prompt, ``>>>``.  (It shouldn't take long.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Numbers"
msgstr "Liczby"

msgid ""
"The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at "
"it and it will write the value.  Expression syntax is straightforward: the "
"operators ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` and ``/`` can be used to perform arithmetic; "
"parentheses (``()``) can be used for grouping. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The integer numbers (e.g. ``2``, ``4``, ``20``) have type :class:`int`, the "
"ones with a fractional part (e.g. ``5.0``, ``1.6``) have type :class:"
"`float`.  We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Division (``/``) always returns a float.  To do :term:`floor division` and "
"get an integer result you can use the ``//`` operator; to calculate the "
"remainder you can use ``%``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With Python, it is possible to use the ``**`` operator to calculate powers "
"[#]_::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The equal sign (``=``) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, "
"no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a variable is not \"defined\" (assigned a value), trying to use it will "
"give you an error::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands "
"convert the integer operand to floating point::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable "
"``_``.  This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it "
"is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This variable should be treated as read-only by the user.  Don't explicitly "
"assign a value to it --- you would create an independent local variable with "
"the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to :class:`int` and :class:`float`, Python supports other types "
"of numbers, such as :class:`~decimal.Decimal` and :class:`~fractions."
"Fraction`. Python also has built-in support for :ref:`complex numbers "
"<typesnumeric>`, and uses the ``j`` or ``J`` suffix to indicate the "
"imaginary part (e.g. ``3+5j``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Text"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python can manipulate text (represented by type :class:`str`, so-called "
"\"strings\") as well as numbers.  This includes characters \"``!``\", words "
"\"``rabbit``\", names \"``Paris``\", sentences \"``Got your back.``\", etc. "
"\"``Yay! :)``\". They can be enclosed in single quotes (``'...'``) or double "
"quotes (``\"...\"``) with the same result [#]_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To quote a quote, we need to \"escape\" it, by preceding it with ``\\``. "
"Alternatively, we can use the other type of quotation marks::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the Python shell, the string definition and output string can look "
"different.  The :func:`print` function produces a more readable output, by "
"omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special "
"characters::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want characters prefaced by ``\\`` to be interpreted as special "
"characters, you can use *raw strings* by adding an ``r`` before the first "
"quote::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is one subtle aspect to raw strings: a raw string may not end in an "
"odd number of ``\\`` characters; see :ref:`the FAQ entry <faq-programming-"
"raw-string-backslash>` for more information and workarounds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"String literals can span multiple lines.  One way is using triple-quotes: "
"``\"\"\"...\"\"\"`` or ``'''...'''``.  End of lines are automatically "
"included in the string, but it's possible to prevent this by adding a ``\\`` "
"at the end of the line.  The following example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not "
"included):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the ``+`` operator, and "
"repeated with ``*``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two or more *string literals* (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next "
"to each other are automatically concatenated. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal, use ``+``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Strings can be *indexed* (subscripted), with the first character having "
"index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string "
"of size one::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to indexing, *slicing* is also supported.  While indexing is "
"used to obtain individual characters, *slicing* allows you to obtain a "
"substring::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, "
"an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded.  This "
"makes sure that ``s[:i] + s[i:]`` is always equal to ``s``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing "
"*between* characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. "
"Then the right edge of the last character of a string of *n* characters has "
"index *n*, for example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0...6 in the "
"string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice "
"from *i* to *j* consists of all characters between the edges labeled *i* and "
"*j*, respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the difference of the "
"indices, if both are within bounds.  For example, the length of "
"``word[1:3]`` is 2."
msgstr ""

msgid "Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for "
"slicing::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python strings cannot be changed --- they are :term:`immutable`. Therefore, "
"assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error::"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you need a different string, you should create a new one::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The built-in function :func:`len` returns the length of a string::"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`textseq`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Strings are examples of *sequence types*, and support the common operations "
"supported by such types."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`string-methods`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Strings support a large number of methods for basic transformations and "
"searching."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The old formatting operations invoked when strings are the left operand of "
"the ``%`` operator are described in more detail here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lists"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python knows a number of *compound* data types, used to group together other "
"values.  The most versatile is the *list*, which can be written as a list of "
"comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.  Lists might contain "
"items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like strings (and all other built-in :term:`sequence` types), lists can be "
"indexed and sliced::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Lists also support operations like concatenation::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike strings, which are :term:`immutable`, lists are a :term:`mutable` "
"type, i.e. it is possible to change their content::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the :meth:`!list."
"append` *method* (we will see more about methods later)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Simple assignment in Python never copies data. When you assign a list to a "
"variable, the variable refers to the *existing list*. Any changes you make "
"to the list through one variable will be seen through all other variables "
"that refer to it.::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements.  "
"This means that the following slice returns a :ref:`shallow copy "
"<shallow_vs_deep_copy>` of the list::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of "
"the list or clear it entirely::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The built-in function :func:`len` also applies to lists::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists), for "
"example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "First Steps Towards Programming"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and "
"two together.  For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the "
"`Fibonacci series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence>`_ as "
"follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid "This example introduces several new features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first line contains a *multiple assignment*: the variables ``a`` and "
"``b`` simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1.  On the last line this is "
"used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are "
"all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place.  The right-"
"hand side expressions are evaluated  from the left to the right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :keyword:`while` loop executes as long as the condition (here: ``a < "
"10``) remains true.  In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is "
"true; zero is false.  The condition may also be a string or list value, in "
"fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences "
"are false.  The test used in the example is a simple comparison.  The "
"standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: ``<`` (less "
"than), ``>`` (greater than), ``==`` (equal to), ``<=`` (less than or equal "
"to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to) and ``!=`` (not equal to)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *body* of the loop is *indented*: indentation is Python's way of "
"grouping statements.  At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or "
"space(s) for each indented line.  In practice you will prepare more "
"complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors "
"have an auto-indent facility.  When a compound statement is entered "
"interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion "
"(since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line).  Note "
"that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`print` function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. "
"It differs from just writing the expression you want to write (as we did "
"earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple "
"arguments, floating point quantities, and strings.  Strings are printed "
"without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format "
"things nicely, like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The keyword argument *end* can be used to avoid the newline after the "
"output, or end the output with a different string::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Footnotes"
msgstr "Przypisy"

msgid ""
"Since ``**`` has higher precedence than ``-``, ``-3**2`` will be interpreted "
"as ``-(3**2)`` and thus result in ``-9``.  To avoid this and get ``9``, you "
"can use ``(-3)**2``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike other languages, special characters such as ``\\n`` have the same "
"meaning with both single (``'...'``) and double (``\"...\"``) quotes. The "
"only difference between the two is that within single quotes you don't need "
"to escape ``\"`` (but you have to escape ``\\'``) and vice versa."
